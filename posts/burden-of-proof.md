# Burden of Proof
The idea here is a tale for kids about what the burden of proof is and how it's important to what we consider fair.

This tale was produced by Grok for this purpose. But it lacks the important task of letting the story connect this to fairness directly through the story instead of explaining it at the end.

This may be a small fix...

# The Case of the Toppled Tower

In the bustling town of Blocksville, little builder Beaver named Benny loved stacking towers with his colorful blocks. One morning, he built his tallest tower yet—ten blocks high! But when he went to grab a juice box, he returned to find it crashed on the ground.

Benny marched to the playground where his pals—Polly the Parrot, Timmy the Toad, and Cara the Cat—were playing. “One of you knocked over my tower!” he declared, pointing a paw.

Polly squawked, “I was flapping up here—no way it was me!”

Timmy croaked, “I was hopping by the pond all morning.”

Cara purred, “I was napping in the sun. Leave me out of it!”

Benny huffed. “Well, it didn’t fall on its own!”

Just then, Granny Goat, the wisest critter in Blocksville, trotted over. “Slow down, Benny,” she said. “In Blocksville, we’ve got a fairness rule called the ‘burden of proof.’ If you say someone did something, it’s on you to show evidence first. That’s step one.”

Benny tilted his head. “Evidence?”

“Yep,” said Granny Goat. “Clues! You’ve got to prove it’s them before they have to prove it’s not.”

So Benny scurried back to his tower. He spotted feathers near the blocks—red ones, like Polly’s! “Aha!” he said, racing back. “Polly, these feathers say it was you!”

Polly’s beak dropped. “Wait a minute! Those could be old feathers—I moulted yesterday!”

Granny Goat raised a hoof. “Hold on, Benny. You’ve got a clue, and that’s a good start. But when you point at Polly with something solid like feathers, the burden shifts. Now it’s on Polly to show she didn’t do it—because fairness means she gets a chance to explain.”

Polly thought fast. “Look!” she said, pointing to the pond. “My feathers from yesterday are still floating there. I wasn’t near your tower today—Timmy saw me flying!”

Timmy nodded. “She’s right—I watched her soar over the pond.”

Benny scratched his head. “Okay, not Polly. But then who?”

Granny Goat smiled. “Keep looking, Benny. The burden’s back on you until you’ve got more.”

Benny checked again and found… muddy webbed footprints! They matched Timmy’s toes perfectly. “Timmy!” Benny cried. “This is you!”

Timmy gulped. “Uh… okay, I hopped too close and bumped it. Sorry, Benny!”

Granny Goat chuckled. “See, kids? The burden starts with the accuser—Benny had to find clues. But when he did, it shifted to Polly, then Timmy, to explain. That back-and-forth keeps it fair—no one’s blamed without a reason, and everyone gets to speak.”

Benny forgave Timmy, and they rebuilt the tower together—taller than ever. And Blocksville stayed a fair, fun place for all.

The End.
