The Mystery of the Missing Cookies
Once upon a time in the cozy village of Critterville, there lived a little fox named Finn who loved baking cookies. One sunny afternoon, Finn baked a big batch of chocolate chip cookies and left them on his windowsill to cool. But when he came back, the cookies were gone!

Finn ran to his friends—Ollie the Owl, Bella the Bunny, and Sammy the Squirrel—who were playing in the meadow. “Someone took my cookies!” Finn cried. “And I think it was one of you!”

Ollie flapped his wings. “Not me! I was flying high all day.”

Bella twitched her nose. “I was hopping around here. No cookies for me!”

Sammy flicked his tail. “I was gathering nuts. Why would I take them?”

Finn crossed his arms. “Well, someone did it, and you’re all acting sneaky!”

Just then, Wise Old Turtle waddled up. “Hold on, Finn,” she said in her slow, calm voice. “You can’t just point paws and say they did it. In Critterville, we have a rule: if you think someone did something, you’ve got to show why. It’s called the ‘burden of proof.’ It’s on you to prove it, not on them to prove they didn’t.”

Finn scratched his head. “But how do I do that?”

“Look for clues!” said Wise Old Turtle. “Check the scene and think it through.”

So Finn dashed back to his house. He sniffed the windowsill and found… muddy paw prints! They were too big for Bella, too small for Ollie’s talons, and didn’t match Sammy’s tiny claws. Then he spotted a crumb trail leading to the river. There, he caught Raccoon Ralph washing his paws, with chocolate smeared on his whiskers.

“Ralph!” Finn shouted. “You took my cookies!”

Ralph grinned sheepishly. “Okay, okay, you got me. They smelled too good!”

Back in the meadow, Finn told his friends, “I’m sorry I blamed you. Wise Old Turtle was right—I had to find proof first.”

Wise Old Turtle nodded. “See, kids? The burden of proof keeps things fair. You don’t blame someone unless you’ve got a good reason—and evidence to back it up.”

From then on, Finn shared his cookies with everyone (even Ralph), and Critterville stayed a happy, fair place.

The End.
